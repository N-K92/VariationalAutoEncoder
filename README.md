# VariationalAutoEncoder
Varitional Autoencoder for denoising the images of MNIST dataset.

In order to run the code, please install the necessary libraries such as
numpy, keras and wandb: pip install wandb

The next step is to train the model on the MNIST dataset. You can specify the value of the noise factor to be applied on the images as well as the nuber of epochs.

After the training is done, the prediction in the test script can be applied. You can specify the index of the image for evaluation. 

The Loss and validation loss can be seen by opening the link of Run page in the library for interacting  API (Weight&Bias). In some cases, a free account should be created.
